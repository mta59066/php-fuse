fuse binding for PHP
------------------------
This extension allows you to build a FUSE-based virtual filesystem in PHP
code.

Prerequisites
------------------------
PHP5.6 (aka bleeding edge dev) is tested and compatible, compiling and
running should be possible on 5.3.

x86 systems have not been tested at all. They're likely to make problems,
too, because PHPs integer datatype is unsigned (31bit), which makes PHP able
to only represent 2GB (as it's stated on every fs-related php manual page).
There will be no official support for x86, it's simply a dying world.

Options parsing
------------------------
Either you do your own, or use FUSEs (which is recommended, because it gives
all filesystem mounters a consistent interface). There's a template in the
examples/ directory that should help you to get started. Please note that
the user_data function is only usable in opt_parse, and even there it's
nearly not as flexible as the original.

!!! Please note that fuse_main enforces -s to explicitly force single-threading !!!

Supported operations
------------------------
getattr
readlink
getdir
mknod
mkdir
unlink
rmdir
symlink
rename
link
chmod
chown
truncate
utime
open
create
read
write
statfs
flush
release
fsync
setxattr
getxattr
listxattr
removexattr

(Currently) Not supported operations
------------------------
opendir
readdir
releasedir
fsyncdir
init
destroy
access
ftruncate
fgetattr
lock
utimens
bmap
ioctl
write_buf
read_buf
flock
fallocate

TODO
------------------------
Thread safety - right now, a mutex should protect the object from
multithreading issues, at least without ZTS. Enabling ZTS and then running the layer
in multi-thread mode will lead to the bad situation that active_object and the mutex
end up in different thread-local storages, or such. At least, the value of
&FUSEG(active_object) is most likely to be NULL. For the love of God, please
let your fingers off multi-threading!

utime has to be replaced by utimens.

init and destroy definitely should be implemented to allow safe
setup/cleanup.
